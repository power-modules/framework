# 👋 Welcome to Modular Framework Discussions!

Welcome to the **Modular Framework** community! We're excited you're here. 

The Modular Framework is a general-purpose modular architecture framework for PHP that helps you build applications where each module is a self-contained unit with its own Dependency Injection container, promoting true encapsulation and clear boundaries.
