# Community Guidelines for Discussions

Welcome to the Modular Framework community! Our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) provides our foundation, and these guidelines offer specific guidance for participating in GitHub Discussions.

## Our Community Values

We're building a community where:
- **Everyone feels welcome** - regardless of experience level, background, or the questions they ask
- **Knowledge flows freely** - experienced developers share insights while newcomers bring fresh perspectives  
- **Collaboration thrives** - we work together to solve problems and improve the framework
- **Quality matters** - we strive for clear, helpful, and constructive communication

## Discussion Guidelines

### üéØ Choosing the Right Category

- **üí¨ General** - Casual conversations, framework philosophy, community updates
- **‚ùì Q&A** - Implementation questions, troubleshooting, "how do I...?" questions
- **üí° Ideas & Feature Requests** - Brainstorming new features, discussing improvements
- **üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design** - Framework internals, design patterns, best practices
- **üéâ Show and tell** - Share your projects, interesting solutions, success stories
- **üêõ Bug Reports** - Potential bugs (will be moved to Issues if confirmed)
- **üìö Documentation** - Suggestions for improving docs and examples

### ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Great Posts

**For Questions:**
- Include relevant code snippets and error messages
- Describe what you've already tried
- Mention your PHP version and OS if relevant
- Search existing discussions first

**For Ideas:**
- Explain the problem you're trying to solve
- Describe who would benefit
- Consider alternatives and trade-offs
- Include usage examples when possible

**For Sharing Work:**
- Explain what makes your solution interesting
- Share code snippets or links to repos
- Describe challenges you overcame
- Help others learn from your experience

### ü§ù Engaging with Others

**When Answering Questions:**
- Be patient with beginners
- Explain the "why" behind your solutions
- Provide working code examples when possible
- Link to relevant documentation

**When Discussing Ideas:**
- Build on others' suggestions constructively
- Consider implementation complexity and backwards compatibility
- Share real-world use cases
- Be open to different approaches

**When Giving Feedback:**
- Focus on the idea, not the person
- Suggest specific improvements
- Acknowledge good points before critiquing
- Offer alternatives when pointing out problems

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do This
- Search before posting to avoid duplicates
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Tag relevant people with @mentions when appropriate
- Mark helpful answers as "accepted" in Q&A discussions
- Update your posts with solutions you find
- Thank people who help you

### ‚ùå Avoid This
- Don't bump old discussions without adding value
- Don't cross-post the same question in multiple categories
- Don't post unrelated advertisements or spam
- Don't ask for help with homework without showing your work
- Don't demand immediate responses or tag maintainers unnecessarily
- Don't post large code dumps without explanation

## Moderation

Our maintainers and community moderators will:
- Help move discussions to appropriate categories
- Convert valuable discussions to Issues when appropriate
- Remove spam, off-topic, or inappropriate content
- Step in when discussions become unproductive

If you see content that violates our guidelines or Code of Conduct, please report it by:
- Using GitHub's report feature
- Contacting maintainers through repository Issues
- Emailing project maintainers
